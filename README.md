**IMPORTANT!! PLEASE READ BEFORE RUNNING: All of my experiments use the validation, train and set test. But, in this version, the code joint the train and validation sets. This code was implemented thinking of that situation. Please, pay attention to this. You need to generated these sets when runing the multi-label cross-validation code.**

## Scripts
This source code consists of an R project for R Studio and the following R scripts:

1. libraries.R
2. utils.R
3. clusTest.R
4. run.R
5. test.R

## Preparing your experiment

### Step-1
This code is executed in X-fold cross-validation (mandatory!). First, you have to obtain the X-fold cross-validation files using this code: https://github.com/cissagatto/CrossValidationMultiLabel (all the instructions to use the code are in the Github). After that, put the results generated in the *datasets* folder in this project. The folder structure generated by the code *CrossValidationMultilabel* is used here.

### Step-2
Place a copy of this code in _"C:/Users/[username]/Test-Best-Partition-Silhouete-TVT"_ or _"/home/[username]/Test-Best-Partition-Silhouete-TVT_. Our files are configured to obtain the paths of the folders from the root project. You can change this in the code if you want.

### Step-3
A file called *datasets-hpmlk.csv* must be in the root project folder. This file is used to read information about the datasets and they are used in the code. All 74 datasets available in cometa (https://cometa.ujaen.es/) are in this file. If you want to use another dataset, please, add the following information about the dataset in the file:

*Id, Name, Domain, Labels, Instances, Attributes, Inputs, Labelsets, Single, Max freq, Card, Dens, MeanIR, Scumble, TCS, AttStart, AttEnd, LabelStart, LabelEnd, xn, yn, gridn*

The _"Id"_ of the dataset is a mandatory parameter in the command line to run all code. The fields are used in a lot of internal functions. Please, make sure that this information is available before running the code. *xn* and *yn* correspond to a dimension of the quadrangular map for kohonen, and *gridn* is *xn* * *yn*. Example: xn = 4, yn = 4, gridn = 16.

### Step-4
Confirms if the folder UTILS contains the following files: Clus.jar, R_csv_2_arff.jar, and weka.jar. Without these jars, the code not runs. Also, confirms if the folder _libs_ is present with the jars: Clus.jar, commons-math-1.0.jar, jgap.jar and weka.jar.

### Step-5
The results stored in the folder _OUTPUT_ in the code https://github.com/cissagatto/Best-Partition-Silhouete-TVT will be used here. Copy the folder with the name of the dataset in the folder _BESTPARTITIONS_.

NOTE: Please, pay attention to the *datasets-hpmlk.csv* names and the names in the CSV file. They must be the same, on the contrary, an error may occur.

## Software Requirements
This code was develop in *RStudio Version 1.4.1106 © 2009-2021 RStudio, PBC "Tiger Daylily" (2389bc24, 2021-02-11) for Ubuntu Bionic Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) QtWebEngine/5.12.8 Chrome/69.0.3497.128 Safari/537.36*. The R Language version was: *R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) -- "Camp Pontanezen" Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)*. 

**Please, make sure all the dependencies are installed (verify libraries.R). This code does not provide any installation of the packages.**

## Hardware Requirements
This code may or may not be executed in parallel, however, it is highly recommended that you run it in parallel. The number of cores can be configured via the command line (_number_cores_). If *number_cores = 1* the code will run sequentially. In our experiments, we used ten cores. For reproducibility, we recommend that you also use ten cores.

This code was tested with the birds dataset in the following machine:

System:

  Host: bionote | Kernel: 5.8.0-53-generic | x86_64 bits: 64 | Desktop: Gnome 3.36.7 | Distro: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (Focal Fossa) 
  
CPU:

  Topology: 6-Core | model: Intel Core i7-10750H | bits: 64 | type: MT MCP | L2 cache: 12.0 MiB | Speed: 800 MHz | min/max: 800/5000 MHz 
  Core speeds (MHz): | 1: 800 | 2: 800 | 3: 800 | 4: 800 | 5: 800 | 6: 800 | 7: 800 | 8: 800 | 9: 800 | 10: 800 | 11: 800 | 12: 800 |
  
_Then the experiment was executed in a cluster at UFSCar._

## Results
The results are stored in the folder _RESULTS_. 

<img src="https://github.com/cissagatto/Test-Best-Partition-Silhouete-TVT/blob/main/images/Resultados-Test-Silhouete.png" width="300">

## RUN
To run the code, open the terminal, enter */home/[username]/Test-Best-Partition-Silhouete-TVT/scripts/* folder, and type:

```
Rscript test.R [number_dataset] [number_cores] [number_folds] [name_folder_results]
```

Where:

_number_dataset_ is the dataset number in the datasets.csv file

_number_cores_ is the total cores you want to use in parallel execution.

_number_folds_ is the number of folds you want for cross-validation

_name_folders_results is the name of the folder to save the results

All parameters are mandatory. Example:

```
Rscript test.R 17 5 10 "/dev/shm/results/"
```

This will execute the code for the dataset number 17 in the _dataset-hpmlk.csv_, with 5 cores, 10 folds and the process will be store in the _/dev/shm/results/_. This code automatically makes a copy of the */dev/shm/results/* in the folder *Results* - which is in the root of the project. In this way, you can run the code using a temporary folder, like *scratch* and *shm*, to speed up the execution.
